# shopping_list_app_2
This React Native app lets you create your own shopping list by adding different goods. Furthermore in this version of the app, you can locate nearby grocery stores (only Frederiksberg kommune in this version) and get an overview in a list. With this new functionality, there is no need to switch to google maps for locating nearby grocery stores.

```
git clone https://github.com/danii1382/shopping_list_app.git
```
3. Open terminal and navigate to the project directory

```
